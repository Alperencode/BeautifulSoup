<h2>What will be in this repository?</h2>
<p>

This repository will contain my own projects, my UpWork jobs source codes and the project that I'm working on with my teacher which mentioned as School-implementation. So far the biggest one is [School-implementation-3](https://github.com/Alperencode/BeautifulSoup/tree/master/School-implementation3). That project is basically based on scraping all the data from some article site and giving them a meaning or making a model wich uses that data. Lastly, I converted that data into json lines. Now I'll try to make a model give a meaning to that data.
