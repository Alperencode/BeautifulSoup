<h2>What will be in this repository?</h2>

<p>
  
This repository will contain ***my own projects***, my ***UpWork jobs source codes*** and ***the project that I'm working on with my teacher*** which mentioned as School-implementation.
<br> 
&emsp;So far the biggest one is [School-implementation-3](https://github.com/Alperencode/BeautifulSoup/tree/master/School-implementation3). That project is basically based on scraping all the data from some article site and giving them a meaning or making a model wich uses that data. Lastly, I converted that data into json lines. Now I'm working on a model to give a meaning to that data.
